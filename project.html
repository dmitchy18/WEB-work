    <h1>My Experience in HTML</h1>
   <P>My experience has not been really easy but quite exciting.The freecode camp project helped me to make a good use of my time in the house during the  strike.It was really tough in the beginning ,most times I wanted to give up but with determination I've made a very good point.
      I couldn't do all on my own so I had to seek help from friends and AI.It was so hard at some point, especially times when I was still getting errors even after so many tries.I try all the time to keep my streak but unfourtunately I've not been able to cross 6
